a switch that is associated with a count down timer of x minutes that startes at a y time on an interval of every z minutes


== Description ==


This is a switch wired up to 4 buttons.  Button A switches mode, Holding button B allows you to edit the integer blinking, Holding button C allows you to increment the blinking integer, Holding button D allows you to decrease the blinking integer.  Holding button B again allows you to stop editing the digits.  To add a given alarm and timer into the array the user will need to go to the Alarm  : Timer menu and hold button B until the units blink in the LCD, then press button C to add the alarm and timer into the arrray.  The timer alarm sequence will be restarted after it has stopped for the interval set in the interval menue.  


== Installation ==


I have yet to establish the wireing schema, but will post when convienent.  This is my first ever Git Hub project.
